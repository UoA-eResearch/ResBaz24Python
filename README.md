This repository contains resources for the ResBaz Aotearoa 2024 Python workshop.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This workshop is designed for beginners with no prior experience in Python. We will use the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) platform to run Python code. To further facilitate this, we have included buttons in the notebooks that will open the notebooks in Google Colab. Please use these.
